In lines of code, the logic flows,
With Python's grace, the program grows.
Indentation neat, the errors slight,
In Python's realm, the future's bright.

From loops and lists to functions grand,
Each script we write is carefully planned.
With libraries vast, we conquer feats,
In Python's world, where code and mind meet.
